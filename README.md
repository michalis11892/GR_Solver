# Overview
GR_Solver is a simple, single-file, script written using symbolic python [python 3.9.5] that takes as input an arbitrary Metric Tensor and automatically calculates and outputs the Christoffel Pseudo-Tensor, Riemann Curvature Tensor, Ricci Tensor, Scalar Curvature and Kretschmann Scalar

## Instructions
1. pip install requirements.txt
2. python GR_Solver.py

In order to modify the metric, simply open the file, edit the  value of the Metric Tensor (g) and the code is ready to be run!

Note: Right now, the default setting is the Schwarzschild Metric.
